Express.js Full Notes
1. Introduction to Express.js
Express.js is a minimalist, unopinionated web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features to build web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware, templates, and more.

2. Setting Up Express.js
2.1 Installing Express

To get started with Express, you first need to install it:

bash
# Initialize a new Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install Express
npm install express
2.2 Basic Express Server Setup

Here's how you can create a basic Express server:

js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
In this example, Express is set up to respond with "Hello, World!" when the root URL is accessed.

3. Express Routing
3.1 Routing Basics

Routes in Express define how the app responds to client requests for specific URLs and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage');
});

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to /submit');
});
3.2 Route Parameters

You can define dynamic routes with parameters:

js
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
In this case, the :id is a route parameter that can be accessed using req.params.

3.3 Query Parameters

You can also capture query parameters using req.query:

js
app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
  const query = req.query.q;
  res.send(`Searching for: ${query}`);
});
3.4 Multiple Routes

You can chain multiple routes for the same path with different HTTP methods:

js
app.route('/user')
  .get((req, res) => res.send('GET request to /user'))
  .post((req, res) => res.send('POST request to /user'))
  .put((req, res) => res.send('PUT request to /user'));
4. Middleware in Express
Middleware is a function that has access to the request, response, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

4.1 Basic Middleware

Middleware functions are used to process requests before they reach your route handlers:

js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received');
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware function
});
4.2 Built-in Middleware

Express has several built-in middleware functions, such as express.static() for serving static files and express.json() for parsing incoming JSON bodies.

js
// Serve static files
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());
4.3 Error Handling Middleware

To handle errors in your application, use a special error-handling middleware. This middleware must have four arguments: err, req, res, next.

js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
5. Handling Requests and Responses
5.1 Sending Responses

You can send responses in various formats:

Text:

js
res.send('Hello, World!');
JSON:

js
res.json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
HTML:

js
res.send('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
5.2 Status Codes

You can set HTTP status codes using res.status():

js
res.status(404).send('Page Not Found');
6. Express Templates
6.1 Template Engines

Express supports template engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars for rendering dynamic HTML pages.

Pug Example:

bash
npm install pug
js
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express', message: 'Hello World' });
});
6.2 Rendering Views

Use the .render() method to render views with a template engine.

js
app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  res.render('profile', { user: req.user });
});
7. Handling Forms in Express
7.1 Parsing Form Data

To handle form submissions, you need to use middleware to parse the form data.

URL-encoded Form Data:

js
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
JSON Data:

js
app.use(express.json());
7.2 Handling POST Requests

Here's an example of handling a POST request with form data:

js
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  res.send(`Logging in as ${username}`);
});
8. Connecting to Databases
You can integrate MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL with Express.

8.1 MongoDB Example (Using Mongoose)

Install Mongoose:

bash
npm install mongoose
Basic MongoDB setup:

js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

const Schema = mongoose.Schema;
const UserSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  age: Number,
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.find();
  res.json(users);
});
8.2 SQL Databases Example (Using Sequelize)

Install Sequelize:

bash
npm install sequelize mysql2
Sequelize setup:

js
const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/mydatabase');

const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  name: DataTypes.STRING,
  age: DataTypes.INTEGER,
});

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await User.findAll();
  res.json(users);
});
9. Authentication and Security
9.1 Using Passport.js for Authentication

Install Passport.js and strategies:

bash
npm install passport passport-local express-session
Set up Passport.js for user authentication:

js
const passport = require('passport');
const LocalStrategy = require('passport-local').Strategy;

passport.use(new LocalStrategy((username, password, done) => {
  // Authenticate user
}));

app.use(express.session({ secret: 'your-secret', resave: false, saveUninitialized: false }));
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
9.2 Hashing Passwords

Use bcryptjs to hash and compare passwords.

bash
npm install bcryptjs
js
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');

// Hash password
bcrypt.hash('password', 10, (err, hash) => {
  // Store hash in your password field
});

// Compare password
bcrypt.compare('password', storedHash, (err, result) => {
  if (result) {
    // Correct password
  } else {
    // Incorrect password
  }
});
10. Error Handling and Debugging
10.1 Global Error Handler

Use a global error handler to catch unhandled errors:

js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});
10.2 Debugging with morgan

Install morgan to log requests:

bash
npm install morgan
Then, use it as middleware:

js
const morgan = require('morgan');
app.use(morgan('dev'));  // Logs request details in the console
11. Running in Production
11.1 Setting Up a Production Server

Use PM2 to manage your application in production:

bash
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start app.js  # Start the app
pm2 restart app.js # Restart the app

React life cycle

In the context of React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces (especially in single-page applications), there are several lifecycle methods and concepts that are commonly discussed, such as componentDidMount, componentWillMount, and PureComponent. These are related to how React components behave when they are created, updated, or destroyed.

However, Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Node.js doesn’t use the same lifecycle methods because it's not a framework for building UI like React is, but I'll explain the concepts in the context of React first and then how they might relate to server-side Node.js applications.

1. componentDidMount (React)
What it is: componentDidMount is a lifecycle method that is called once after the component is rendered and mounted in the DOM (Document Object Model).
When it’s used: This method is typically used for actions like:
Fetching data from an API after the component is rendered.
Setting up subscriptions or timers.
Any post-mounting side effects that should only happen once.
javascript
Copy code
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Example: Fetch data from API after the component mounts
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state ? this.state.data : "Loading..."}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
2. componentWillMount (React) (Deprecated in newer versions of React)
What it was: componentWillMount was a lifecycle method that was called before a component was mounted to the DOM, right before the initial render.
When it was used: It could be used for:
Preparing data or performing setup tasks before the render.
Modifying the state or props before the component is mounted.
Deprecation: In React 17 and above, this method has been deprecated due to issues with asynchronous rendering. It’s recommended to avoid using it, and instead, use constructor or componentDidMount for such logic.
Example of how componentWillMount might have been used:

javascript
Copy code
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  componentWillMount() {
    console.log("Component will mount");
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Component content</div>;
  }
}
Since componentWillMount is deprecated, it’s better to use constructor() or componentDidMount instead.

3. PureComponent (React)
What it is: PureComponent is a special version of React.Component. It automatically implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow comparison of props and state.
When it’s used: It helps optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. If the props or state haven’t changed (according to a shallow comparison), the component will not re-render, which can improve performance in large applications with many components.
javascript
Copy code
class MyPureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.text}</div>;
  }
}
In this example, MyPureComponent will only re-render if the text prop changes. If the text prop is the same, it won’t re-render.
